This is a fun project that i created for an nft community (CETS) that i'm part of.

A lot of holders, especially new ones face 2 major inconveniences:

(1) there is no place to showcase the 3 versions of their nft

(2) it's also hard and inconvinient to check if their nft is upgraded or not

This website solve both of the problems by just providing the token address of the nft.
